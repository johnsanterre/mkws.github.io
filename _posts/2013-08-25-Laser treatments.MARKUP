Low density laser treatments are now available at Wells Dog & Cat Hospital.  Laser treatments have been shown effective in relieving discomfort of arthritis and speeding the healing process when administered before and after a surgical procedure.  They are usually most effective when given several times over a 10-14 day time period.  Ask Dr. Santerre about his thoughts if you are considering laser treatments for your pet.  Then ask him about the effect on his senior black lab.
